### Branches / Pull Requests

The **master** branch is used for holding the most stable release of the app.

The **develop** branch is used for development and any feature/fix being worked on needs to be based off of this branch.

Make pull requests for your branch if you want it merged into the **develop** branch on remote (GITHUB).

### Versioning / Builds

When merging **develop** code into the **master** branch, the following steps must be done:

1. Create a [git tag](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging) with the same version.

2. Commit and push the changes (including tags) to **develop** branch on remote (GITHUB).
